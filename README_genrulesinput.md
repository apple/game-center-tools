# Writing matchmaking rule expressions

**Abstract:**

Explore rule expressions using the [JMESPath playground](https://play.jmespath.org) and use a Python 3 script to generate the rule based matchmaking JSON input.


## Overview

[Rule based matchmaking](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit/matchmaking_rules) uses expressions in the [JMESPath JSON query language](https://jmespath.org) against JSON representations of match requests to select the best requests for a match.
The expressions can be complex and it may be useful to explore the resuls of intermediate expressions in order to obtain the desired result.
Explore	rule expressions using the [JMESPath playground](https://play.jmespath.org) with example input representing requests in the queue.
The structure of the JSON used as input when evaluating the expressions is described in the App Store Connect API documentation for [Expressions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/game_center/expressions).
However, it can be tedious and time consuming to construct the input manually.
Use the script  to generate the input from the same compact input as the `testrules.py` script.

For a complete list of the `genrulesinput.py` arguments, run the  `genrulesinput.py â€”h` command.

## Example 1

In The first example there are 3 requests in the queue:

1. Player skill = 1, submitted 20 seconds ago.
2. Player skill = 50, submitted 10 seconds ago.
3. Request from player with skill = 20, invited player skill = 30, submitted just now.

Run the [genrulesinput.py](https://github.com/apple/game-center-tools/README_genrulesinput.md) script with the input shown to generate the input for these requests.

```
$ genrulesinput.py << 'EOF'
> [
>   {"secondsInQueue":20, "skill":1},
>   {"secondsInQueue":10, "skill":50},
>   [{"skill":20}, {"skill":30}]
> ]
> EOF
{           
    "requests": [
        {       
            "requestName": "r1",
            "playerId": "r1_p1",
            "properties": {
                "skill": 1
            },
...
                    "properties": {
                        "skill": 30
                    },
                    "requestName": "r3"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The generated input is over 160 lines and so it is left to the reader to run the script as above and paste the generated input into the [JMESPath playground](https://play.jmespath.org) "Input JSON" field.

Enter `players[].properties.skill` into the expression field and observe the content of the "Result" field and observe the `Result` field contains an array of the skill value for each player.

```
[
  1,
  50,
  20,
  30
]
```

The [diff](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/game_center/expressions/computing_numeric_differences) function can be used evaluate the skill range when used in a MATCH rule expression.
Currently this isn't available in the [JMESPath playground](https://play.jmespath.org).

If you use the expression `requests[].properties.skill` the result only contains the skill values for the players making the requests and doesn't include the value provided for the invited player.
This is the difference between the `players` and the `requests` object that is provided at the root of the generated input.

```
[
  1,
  50,
  20
]
```

Enter `requests[].secondsInQueue` to obtain an array of the time in the queue for each request.

```
[
  20,
  10,
  0
]
```

Enter `avg(requests[].secondsInQueue)` to calculate the average age of the requests.
The result will be `10`.

### Example 2

In the second example there are 2 new requests:

1. Request from an older version of the app where no skill property is provided.
2. Request from a new version of the app where a skill of 45 is provided.

```
$ genrulesinput.py << 'EOF'
> [
>   {"skill":45},
>   {}
> ]
> EOF
...
    "players": [
        {
            "playerId": "r1_p1",
            "properties": {
                "skill": 45
            },
            "requestName": "r1"
        },
        {
            "playerId": "r2_p1",
            "properties": {},
            "requestName": "r2"
        }
    ],
...
```

The objective is to write an expression that evaluates an array which contains a skill value for each requests and provides a default value where no skill property is provided.
Enter the expression used before `players[].properties.skill` to obtain an array of skill values.

```
[
  45
]
```

Enter `requests[].properties.[ skill, ``50``]` to generate an array for each request where the first element is the actual skill value and the second is the default skill value of `50`.

```
[
  [
    45,
    50
  ],
  [
    null,
    50
  ]
]
```

Enter `requests[].properties.[ skill, ``50``][*].not_null(@) | [*][0]` which flattens the arrays one level, filters out null values, pipes the results to select the first element, and flattens again into a single array of a skill value for each request.

```
[
  45,
  50
]
```

This can then be used to evaluate a skill range and compare to the desired skill range for the match.

As you can see the [JMESPath JSON query language](https://jmespath.org) is very powerful and it is helpful to have a playground to explore complex expressions.
